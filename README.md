# ⭐ sid-cypress-rerun-failed

A Cypress plugin and CLI tool that automatically **reruns only failed spec files** from the previous Cypress run.  
It helps reduce flaky failures, saves CI time, and avoids rerunning the entire test suite.

---

## ❓ What problem does this solve?

In real-world Cypress projects:

- Tests can be **flaky**
- CI pipelines fail even when reruns would pass
- Rerunning the **entire suite** is slow and expensive

### ✅ This plugin solves that by:
- Detecting **only failed spec files**
- Rerunning **only those specs**
- Optionally auto‑rerunning in CI (opt‑in, safe by default)

---

## 📦 Installation

Install as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install sid-cypress-rerun-failed --save-dev
```

## JavaScript cypress.config.js

```
const rerunFailed = require("sid-cypress-rerun-failed");

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      rerunFailed(on, config);
      return config;
    }
  }
};
```
## TypeScript (cypress.config.ts)

```
import rerunFailed from "sid-cypress-rerun-failed";
import { defineConfig } from "cypress";

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      rerunFailed(on, config);
      return config;
    }
  }
});
```

▶️ How to Use
Step 1: Run Cypress normally
```
npx cypress run
```
If any specs fail, the plugin generates:
```
cypress/failed-specs.json
```
Step 2: Rerun only failed specs
```
npx cypress-rerun-failed
```
Only the failed spec files from the last run are executed.
